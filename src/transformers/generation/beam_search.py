    [`BeamScorer`] implementing standard beam search decoding.

    Reference for the diverse beam search algorithm and implementation [Ashwin Kalyan's DBS
    implementation](https://github.com/ashwinkalyan/dbs/blob/master/dbs/beam_utils.lua)

    Args:
        batch_size (`int`):
            Batch Size of `input_ids` for which standard beam search decoding is run in parallel.
        num_beams (`int`):
            Number of beams for beam search.
        device (`torch.device`):
            Defines the device type (*e.g.*, `"cpu"` or `"cuda"`) on which this instance of `BeamSearchScorer` will be
            allocated.
        length_penalty (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1.0):
            Exponential penalty to the length that is used with beam-based generation. It is applied as an exponent to
            the sequence length, which in turn is used to divide the score of the sequence. Since the score is the log
            likelihood of the sequence (i.e. negative), `length_penalty` > 0.0 promotes longer sequences, while
            `length_penalty` < 0.0 encourages shorter sequences.
        do_early_stopping (`bool` or `str`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Controls the stopping condition for beam-based methods, like beam-search. It accepts the following values:
            `True`, where the generation stops as soon as there are `num_beams` complete candidates; `False`, where an
            heuristic is applied and the generation stops when is it very unlikely to find better candidates;
            `"never"`, where the beam search procedure only stops when there cannot be better candidates (canonical
            beam search algorithm).
        num_beam_hyps_to_keep (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            The number of beam hypotheses that shall be returned upon calling
            [`~transformers.BeamSearchScorer.finalize`].
        num_beam_groups (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            Number of groups to divide `num_beams` into in order to ensure diversity among different groups of beams.
            See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02424.pdf) for more details.
        max_length (`int`, *optional*):
            The maximum length of the sequence to be generated.

class ConstrainedBeamSearchScorer(BeamScorer):
    r"""
    [`BeamScorer`] implementing constrained beam search decoding.


    Args:
        batch_size (`int`):
            Batch Size of `input_ids` for which standard beam search decoding is run in parallel.
        num_beams (`int`):
            Number of beams for beam search.
        constraints (`List[Constraint]`):
            A list of positive constraints represented as `Constraint` objects that must be fulfilled in the generation
            output. For more information, the documentation of [`Constraint`] should be read.
        device (`torch.device`):
            Defines the device type (*e.g.*, `"cpu"` or `"cuda"`) on which this instance of `BeamSearchScorer` will be
            allocated.
        length_penalty (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1.0):
            Exponential penalty to the length that is used with beam-based generation. It is applied as an exponent to
            the sequence length, which in turn is used to divide the score of the sequence. Since the score is the log
            likelihood of the sequence (i.e. negative), `length_penalty` > 0.0 promotes longer sequences, while
            `length_penalty` < 0.0 encourages shorter sequences.
        do_early_stopping (`bool` or `str`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Controls the stopping condition for beam-based methods, like beam-search. It accepts the following values:
            `True`, where the generation stops as soon as there are `num_beams` complete candidates; `False`, where an
            heuristic is applied and the generation stops when is it very unlikely to find better candidates;
            `"never"`, where the beam search procedure only stops when there cannot be better candidates (canonical
            beam search algorithm).
        num_beam_hyps_to_keep (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            The number of beam hypotheses that shall be returned upon calling
            [`~transformers.BeamSearchScorer.finalize`].
        num_beam_groups (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            Number of groups to divide `num_beams` into in order to ensure diversity among different groups of beams.
            See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02424.pdf) for more details.
        max_length (`int`, *optional*):
            The maximum length of the sequence to be generated.
